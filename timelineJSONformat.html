        "headline": "The Colden Correspondence", 
        "text": "<p>The Colden correspondence is the communications of Cadwallader Colden(1688-1776), who was an early botanist who worked with his daughter Jane to find and document plants. He corresponded with Linneaus, John Bartram, Benjamin Franklin, and many other early male scientists. His letters often covered the topics of medicine, physics, and botany. He was celebrated for having complicated critiques of Newton, and he primarily discussed these opinions in his correspondence with Benjamin Franklin. They often discussed high level mathematical concepts. \n\n<p>Apart from botany, these were all subjects that women were denied entry to during this time. The correspondence spans the emergence of the Linnean system of plant classification, and hence contains many discussions on the subject. Hence, even with botany, Cadwallader and his correspondents often discussed the sexual nature of plant reproduction. It effectively added a barrier to women participating in botany, including his daughter Jane Colden. As evidenced by some of her letters, she often had to navigate the discussion of botanical knowledge while balancing the idea of propriety as a woman. Cadwallader\u2019s mentions of Jane begin in the 1750s. Much of her botanical correspondence occurs through him, which also results in lack of credit for Jane\u2019s work.\n\n<p>This correspondence also demonstrates barriers based on race. In 1727, Colden published \"History of Five Indian Nations\" demonstrating his interest in Indian affairs, as a result of being the first colonial representative in the group of Native Americans living near the great lakes. Much of his correspondence contains reviews and opinions about his book. He also gave opinions on many native land disputes with settlers. When Cadwallader mentions Native Americans in his botanical correspondence, he mainly highlights things he has learnt from Native medicinal plant uses. He also talks about how he had native guides when observing specimens in new territories, yet he rarely credits this Native knowledge. Readers can look to this correspondence to understand how this indigenous knowledge got translated to Jane\u2019s manuscript. [SD]"

Nonetheless, power remains in the worship of women as the holders of knowledge. 5000BCE-500CE"

        "text": "Margaret Hill Morris and her written works are examples of how much gender played into the way that women participated in medicine in Revolutionary America. The way they wrote about their practices mimicked the way that they learned medicine. It was not intended to be broadcasted into the world, and especially kept within family lines. Morris had an advantage by having so much access to people in the field, both professionally and unprofessionally, yet she still suffered the same limitations that so many other female healers had to experience. Still, her writings, after looking through her personal details and historical information, show how much female healers knew of at the time and how much room there was for them to learn more. <p> Recontextualizing women\u2019s writings to find their relationship to medicine and science is something that is not new and will continue to happen. By looking more in depth at how and why women write about medicine in a certain way, one can uncover the ways that societies thought of those who practiced medicine. Morris found herself in a time and place that allowed her to be able to practice medicine. Living in a religious free place that encouraged and wanted medical futurity, she could learn more about medicine and how she can practice it. She formed her own business and then treated soldiers on both sides of a war because of her reputation as a respectable practitioner and docteress. Due to all these factors, Morris was able to become a healer that was known in her community, and through her writings, to historians in the future. - [Emma Regan] <p>"

        "text": "Laura Bassi was the second woman to receive a degree from the University of Bologna and the first woman to be offered an official teaching position at any university in Europe. She graduated from the University of Bologna in 1732, the same year as when she took part in her first academic dispute. In 1734 Laura Bassi began to appear annually as one of the disputants at the famed carnival anatomy. Later she was a lecturer at the University of Bologna, a member of the Academy of the Institute for Sciences, and one of the first scholars in Italy to teach Newtonian natural philosophy. In 1776 Bassi became the chair of experimental physics on the Academy of the Institute for Sciences and was the highest paid member of the faculty.  She was a woman who came from exceptional circumstances and received unique opportunities for academic success because of these circumstances.  Her incredible accomplishments were in large part due to her high social status and ability to navigate the cultural landscape of Bologna in the early eighteenth century.  Her achievements demonstrated both the ability of women to be valuable participants in the practice of science and the ability of the academy to support them in their scientific pursuits.  Despite this, Laura Bassi did not directly pave the way for other women to enter science.  After her death, male academic authorities began to place less and less value on the presence of women in the University.  By the end of the eighteenth century, women were almost completely excluded from spaces where science was formally praticed.   In this way, Laura Bassi represents a missed opportunity for the inclusion of women in science. \n - JF, LS"

His willingness to vouch for Bassi was one of the factors which allowed her to practice science without the gender-based restrictions which were imposed on both her predecessors and successors.  The development of Bassi's relationship with Lambertini was supported by Italy's use of the Renaissance model of the academy, which encouraged interaction between learned men and women. - JF"

These two women differed greatly, however, in terms of their views on how and if at all women should serve as midwives in 18th century America. According to one of her diary entries on October 24, 1799,  \"\u2018...when Dan told us that his Mistress had a fine boy and was as well as could be expected - ... I was thankful, that I happened to be absent at the time, tho' I intended otherwise, Doctor Shippen told me that he thought he should have had occasion for instruments\u2026\u2019\" , to which Catherine Teets-Parzynski of Lehigh University responded, \"These are hardly the type of sentiments we would expect to hear from a woman comfortable with the traditional role as a birth attendant.\" (33) The fact that there was much distance placed between Drinker and her pregnant daughter, Sally, demonstrates that there was not a consensus throughout all of society that women should be the frontrunners as midwives. It could be related to the fact that her Quaker background encourages people from distancing themselves from the pains of childbirth. Nonetheless, Elizabeth Drinker put her trust into the guidance of a male physician, and a physician who believed the use of medical tools were better than natural methods (a strategy Ballard used based on her knowledge of botany). To continue emphasizing this point, Teets-Parzynski says, \"Unlike Martha Ballard of Hallowell, Maine (1735-1812), who delivered over 900 children in the period from 1785 to 1812 and felt comfortable doing it, Elizabeth Drinker avoided the lying-in chamber. Not all women considered being present in the delivery room a joy.\" (27) Drinker demonstrated that she was not interested in serving as the traditional midwife, not even to her daughter, insinuating the trust she gave to men obstetricians. As a result, Drinker did not follow the popular notion that women should be midwives in the 18th century.  -Gillian Cuba"

She began by selling herbs from her garden, then opening an apothecary in Philadelphia, and eventually began practicing medicine at the Philadelphia and Friends\u2019 Alms Houses and the Pennsylvania Hospital. 2 (Morris, Margaret Morris, Burlington - N.J. 1804, 3.)

In 1753, she found 140 plants, all of which were wild and required exertion to document. Jane focused more on sharpening her documentation methods. She constructed her notebook through indexing, illustrations, and plant descriptions. She began to learn botanical Latin to further legitimize her documentation. Once she compiled her manuscript, her father sent it to many people abroad. She received a lot of praise for this, particularly from John Bartram and Linnaeus.\n\n<p>Her manuscript contained detailed descriptions of the structure of the flower, fruit, and plants, as well as the medicinal and culinary properties of these plants. Through looking at mentions of Jane in the Colden correspondence as well as Jane\u2019s correspondence with John Bartram, readers will be able to understand how gender and race played into her manuscripts. Both Bartram and Cadwallader talk about talking to Native Americans to gain indigenous knowledge. Further, they often employed indigenous people as guides when traveling through the countryside to make scientific observations. Because Jane was frequently shut out of these conversations due to gender dynamics, it is important to uncover the knowledge she gained for her manuscript from her father and her correspondent's interactions with native people. John Bartram communicates with Jane mostly through her father, and her father begins to mention her in correspondences from the 1750s. Jane\u2019s manuscript contains indigenous knowledge particularly when it comes to medicinal uses of plants.  [SD]"

She met Eli Whitney in 1792, and within a year he had produced a working model of the cotton gin. Her status as a woman during the Revolutionary War prevented her from taking credit for this idea. This is related to separate spheres because during that time, she was confined to the domestic sphere for being a woman and taking credit for her idea would have been seen as intruding in the professional sphere. The cotton gin had huge industrial influence; it allowed three hundred pounds of cotton to be separated from lint daily at the same cost of cleaning a single pound by hand. The cotton gin is also #1 on the list of sixteen American inventions adopted by the world. -VR"

She manipulated social norms to promote the legitimacy of her practice, encouraging women to be involved in science (something they can do at home, which satisfies gendered norms). \nTreat also corresponded with Darwin and was heavily influenced by his theories. She advocated a \"model of the natural world that focused on the scientific rather than moral connections in nature\" (Gianquitto, \"Spiders, Ants, and Carnivorous Plants: Mary Treat and Evolutionary Science\", 2007). She also explicitly talked about herself as a member of a new group of professional scientists. These were major departures from the Phelps structure where women were encouraged to be involved in science only as a way to supplement and enhance their role as homekeepers and moral centers. -GC, VR, EF, HB\n"

In 1850, Hunt petitions Harvard again and this time is let in by the administration, along with three African American men.

In relation to midwifery and men entering into the obstetrics field, Cook believes that men are too emotionally detached from taking care of their patients, making them inappropriate candidates for taking care of women, like during childbirth. On page 22 of the preface, she comments on Elizabeth Blackwell\u2019s attitude of women in the medical field: \"\u2018...women have greater interest in their patients than in disease, and this leads them to study the means of guarding against sickness, as well as curing it. Men, on the other hand, lean toward the scientific aspect of disease, and seldom look beyond the cure...\u2019\" Referencing this statement not only reflects how women\u2019s emotional capacities are useful upon treating patients, but also how men are not the idealistic doctors society is assumes them to be. Often times, women were regarded as emotional to point out their inability to be logical and therefore mentally \"deficient\" to study science. However, Cook is challenging social convention by pointing out how men\u2019s strategy is harmful in the profession, which makes women better candidates as midwives and doctors in 19th century America. To add on to this perception, Cook says on page 6 of the preface, \"Men are too full of business occupations, which are constantly multiplying, to give this subject the thought it fully demands.\" Contradictory to how men believed professionalization was the key to elevating their influence, she believes it distracts men from actually doing their job correctly. Preoccupied with making their vocations professionalized, men do not see the needs women patients have, leaving women with no choice but to fend for themselves, but without medical knowledge. As a result, Cook stresses the importance of women becoming educated and more involved in medicine because men do not have the full capacity to care for others (namely women) in a way that only women can.  -Gillian Cuba"

Mitchell wanted to give women the opportunity to study science and believed that women should be recruited to practice science. She worked with women\u2019s clubs to learn more about women\u2019s education and sent out a survey among her friends and colleagues to collect more information about women in science. Although her research was not as successful immediately, her push to add more women in science led to an increase at the end of the century to include more women in scientific education."

For each plant in the book, Hale provided poems explaining the sentiment and meaning that the plant communicated. She also included a section of \"Botanical Explanations\" with scientific information to enable the reader to classify flowers based off the system of counting stamens and pistils. </p>\n\n<p>This book was intended for a young and American audience. In the introduction, Hale wrote: \"To the youth of America we dedicate anew this book we have prepared for them. May it inspire our young women to cultivate those virtues which can only be represented by the fairest flowers ; and may our young men strive to be worthy of the love that these fairest flowers can so eloquently reveal\" (Hale iv).</p>\n\n<p>This quote illustrates the gendering of mid-nineteenth century American botany. Similar to the view represented by [Phelps\u2019 <i>Familiar Lectures on Botany</i>], Hale\u2019s <i>Flora\u2019s Interpreter</i> encouraged women to engage with science, but only for the sake of communicating it to others. By establishing botanical knowledge as a prerequisite for gifting flowers, this book serves as one example of the way that science could be tied into social engagement for nineteenth century women. Women were meant to use this book to both communicate their love to men (as indicated by the above quote), and to each other. Floral interpreters would often serve as references when women were choosing flowers to draw in each other\u2019s signature albums, books that woman would pass around to friends to collect their signatures and well-wishes. This link between botany and social connections allowed women to access science while also focusing on building family life. -[Hannah Beilinson]</p>\n\n"

Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. Collins attended Bryn Mawr College. This album was given to her by her mother in August of 1879, when Collins was only thirteen years old. It is a floral album, a kind of book that was sold in the nineteenth century with the intention that a person would pass it around to their friends to collect signatures and sentiments. The album came with many of the pages already having accurate and beautiful lithographs of different flowers, with labels for each flower. Additionally, Collins\u2019s friends added signatures, drawings, poetry, and a few paintings. There is also evidence that there were actual plants pressed into one page of the book at some point. </p>\n\n<p>This album serves as an example of how science was ingrained in communities of nineteenth century women. Different flowers encoded different sentiments, as described in floral interpreters, such as Sarah Josepha Hale\u2019s [<i>Flora's Interpreter: And Fortuna Flora</i>]. To decode these meanings Collins would have had to be well-versed in the distinctions between different flowers. In addition to drawings of flowers, the album contains a drawing of an alligator eating a frog, signed from \"Your Scientific Friend.\" The album also has a painting of a woman standing in a stream and examining a tree, labeled \"The Undine of Sage\u2019s Ravine; Berkshire Hills Aug 1883.\" All of these drawings show that science and nature were fundamental parts of Collins\u2019s communication and relationships.

After graduating, she practced in Boston for some time, specializing in caring for women and children. After the civil war, she moved to the Virginia to care for black patients, especially former slaves. In 1869, she returned to Boston and continued to practice in a primarily black neighborhood. In 1883, she published A Book of Medical Discourses. Crumpler faced difficulties with regard to being accepted as a physician not only because of her gender but also because of her race. There were a few faculty members from NEFMC who opposed her graduation, but they agreed to recommend her after pressure from Trustees. She practiced medicine in the postwar south, although black physicians were not well accepted there; it is implied that she faced opposition. Nevertheless, she used her knowledge and title as a physician to treat southern blacks in need of medical care, encourage African Americans to pursue medicine, and include black women in medical discourse. -VR"

Marion Sims is referred to today as the \"Father of Gynecology\" because he invented the vaginal speculum and developed a surgery to repair vesicovaginal fistula, a painful condition in which a woman develops holes in the bladder and the rectum after a difficult childbirth and of which there was no cure before Sims. However, he developed this surgery by performing dozens of risky experiments on 10 or 11 (different depending on the source) enslaved women from 1845-1849. We know the names of three of these women \u2014 Anarcha, Lucy, and Betsey \u2014 because he wrote about them in his various books. However, none of the descriptions of their surgery were from these women\u2019s perspectives. He performed these experiments without anesthesia since anesthesia was still very experimental and not commonly used at the time, so these women had to endure great amounts of pain during the procedures: Anarcha underwent 30 surgeries without anesthesia during this four year period and Lucy feared for her life because of the intense pain. All three of these women were brought to Sims by their slavemasters to be operated on because part of a female slave\u2019s value was her ability to produce children \u2014 something women with vesicovaginal fistula were unable to do \u2014 and because these women were in great amounts of pain. Sims claimed in the New York Medical Gazette and Journal of Health that he asked all of his patients for consent before operating on them. But, it seems unreasonable to believe that an enslaved woman brought to a doctor by their master really had a choice about whether or not they wanted to undergo experimental procedures. The sacrifices of these women deserve to be remembered by history, not just because of the extreme trauma they underwent, but because they were major contributors, along with the \"father of gynecology\", in building the foundation of modern gynecology. - Maggie Weisblum"

It is not clear how they were chosen to work as midwives rather than doing fieldwork or housework, but some historians hypothesize that young women were chosen and trained by older midwives. In the antebellum period, many enslaved midwives formed professional and respectful relationships with doctors because they agreed to call the doctor if the childbirth was difficult or high-risk. Involving doctors in birth meant using intimidating tools like forceps, something that midwives never used. Usually, enslaved African-American women preferred to have their baby delivered by an enslaved midwife, since it helped them preserve their autonomy: there is a long history of white men raping enslaved African-American women in America, so many of these women did want to involve white men during their intimate childbirths. On the other hand, white slave-owning women seemed to prefer white male doctors. There were also many births that were attended by a doctor and a midwife. In 1900, midwives assisted in 50% of births and doctors assisted in the other 50%, so the role of midwives was still pretty prevalent in American childbirth by the start of the 20th century. It is important to remember the role these women played because it is not as if doctors took over the work of midwives overnight. While childbirth was being professionalized throughout the 19th century, midwives were still actively working and offering women a more comfortable and less intrusive birth experience. - Maggie Weisblum\n"

        "text": "Margaret E. Knight was born in York, Maine, in Feb. 14, 1838. She is one of the best known women inventors of the 19th century and is most widely remembered for the flat-bottomed plastic bag. She left school early, at the age of 12, to start working in a cotton mill to support her family financially. Even though cotton mills were considered dangerous places for everyone, especially a young girl, Margaret took advantage of her experience there to come up with one of her first known inventions. It is reported that when one of the cotton mill shuttles fell out and injured someone with its steel tip, Margaret worked out a stop-motion contrivance to prevent similar accidents in the future. Based on Patent Office records, she received a total of twenty-seven patents to work on her inventions, which ranged from dress shields to window frames that required heavy machinery. Orbituary notices have praised her as a \"woman Edison\" and her achievements are remembered as extraordinary, given that Knight never had a formal education beyond secondary school."

        "text": "At thirty-two years old, Knight takes out her first patent, which was meant to be an improvement to a paper-feeding machine that would enable it to fold square-bottom paper bags. Her machine gave the bags the iconic flat base that made packing items much easier, a significant improvement from the cone containers that were used prior to that. Knight ran into trouble when a man called Charles Annan who worked at the same company, Columbia Paper Bag Company, attempted to steal her idea and claim credit for the invention. Luckily, Knight had her original blueprints and was able to file a successful patent lawsuit, finally receiving a patent for her work in 1871. A model of Knight\u2019s machine can be found in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History."

Much of her acclaim comes from her publication of [\"North American Wildflowers\"] in 1925 and her marriage to Charles Doolitte Walcott, the fourth Secretary of the Simthsonian, in 1914. This obscures the work she did with her family, beginning with a trip to the Canadian Rockies in 1887, documenting the movement of glaciers, taking photographs, and doing extensive climbing work. She remarked frequently about how much she loved to be up in mountains, away from civilization and aimed to be as scientifically accurate with both her painting and photographic work. - LS"
